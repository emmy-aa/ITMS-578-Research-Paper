## Overview
This repository contains the research, resources, and documentation for the study "Firewalls to Identity: Rethinking Network Security with Zero Trust Architecture." The project addresses the transition from traditional perimeter-based network defenses to identity-centric Zero Trust approaches in distributed environments.

## Research Objective
The primary research goal is to critically analyze the effectiveness, challenges, and implementation strategies of Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) as a replacement for legacy firewall-based security.  
**Key Questions:**
- How do identity-based controls and adaptive trust models enhance security compared to traditional firewalls in modern digital environments?
- What are the stepwise methodology and challenges when migrating real-world organizations from perimeter to Zero Trust models?

## Methodology
- Conduct a comparative literature review using the baseline paper ("A Review and Comparative Analysis of Relevant Approaches of Zero Trust Network Model") and other current Zero Trust research.
- Analyze case studies and industry deployments to evaluate migration steps, obstacles, and best practices.
- Propose new frameworks for identity-based access control and adaptive trust metrics in diverse environments.
