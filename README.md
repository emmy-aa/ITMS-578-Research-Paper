# Firewalls to Identity: Rethinking Network Security with Zero Trust Architecture

## Overview
This repository contains the research, resources, and documentation for the study "Firewalls to Identity: Rethinking Network Security with Zero Trust Architecture." The project addresses the transition from traditional perimeter-based network defenses to identity-centric Zero Trust approaches in distributed environments.

## Research Objective
The primary research goal is to critically analyze the effectiveness, challenges, and implementation strategies of Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) as a replacement for legacy firewall-based security.  
**Key Questions:**
- How do identity-based controls and adaptive trust models enhance security compared to traditional firewalls in modern digital environments?
- What are the stepwise methodology and challenges when migrating real-world organizations from perimeter to Zero Trust models?

## Methodology
- Conduct a comparative literature review using the baseline paper ("A Review and Comparative Analysis of Relevant Approaches of Zero Trust Network Model") and other current Zero Trust research.
- Analyze case studies and industry deployments to evaluate migration steps, obstacles, and best practices.
- Propose new frameworks for identity-based access control and adaptive trust metrics in diverse environments.



## Main Problem Statement Of Our Baseline Paper 

While Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) has gained recognition as a prevalent approach for implementing Zero Trust principles in network security, there is currently no standardized or universally accepted method or framework for effectively deploying and managing Zero Trust across different environments such as cloud, edge, IoT, and 5G/6G networks. 
This paper addresses the problem by reviewing and comparing current Zero Trust models to identify their strengths, weaknesses, and unresolved challenges, ultimately guiding future research toward more cohesive and adaptable ZTA solutions.
